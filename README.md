# Keyboards

This repository serves as a place to store my keyboard configurations as well as make compiling and flashing the firmware easier. Please feel free to completely rip off anything you find useful within this repository.

So far I have the following keyboards that I lovingly put together (or purchased, in the case of the Model 01):

 * Two (yes, _two_) [Infinity Ergodox][ergodox] from separate [Massdrop][] drops. One is an early model, another is the newer one featuring USB-C connectors and O-rings on the caps.
 * A [Planck][] which I sourced from all over the internet, including a [wooden case][planck-case] from [Massdrop][] as well. Featuring green LEDs and a custom green cable from [Pexon][].
 * A [Model 01][model01] from the original Kickstarter.

## Usage

This depends on the keyboard, just `cd` into the required directory and check out the `Makefile`. The scripts assume you're running Arch Linux because that's what I use, you'll have to adjust them slightly for other distros and operating systems.
